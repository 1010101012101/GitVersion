# Creating/Updating Examples
The examples are generated by GitVersion tests, put into gists then use a service to render them as sequence diagrams.

 - [Plantuml gist rendering service](http://uml.mvnsearch.org)

The tests are quite simple. Using the methods on the `fixture` itself will record that action in the sequence diagram. If you do not want the action recorded perform the action directly on the repository (`fixture.Repository.`)
