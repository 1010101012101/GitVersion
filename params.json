{"name":"GitVersion","tagline":"Use convention to derive a SemVer product version from a Git repository","body":"![Icon](https://raw.github.com/Particular/GitVersion/master/Icons/package_icon.png)\r\n\r\nThe easy way to use semantic versioning (semver.org) with a Git.\r\n\r\nGitVersion uses your *git* repository branching conventions to determine the current [Semantic Version](http://semver.org) of your application. It supports [GitFlow](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion/wiki/GitFlow) and the much simpler [GitHubFlow](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion/wiki/GitHubFlow) and might work with others (let us know).\r\n\r\nGitVersion in action!\r\n\r\n![README](Icons/README.png)\r\n\r\nYou are seeing:\r\n\r\n - Pull requests being built as pre-release builds\r\n - A branch called `release-1.0.0` producing beta v1 packages\r\n\r\nOnce a release is done, and you **tag** the commit which was released, the version will automatically be bumped. See our wiki for the rules and examples of how we increment the SemVer.\r\n\r\n## Usage:\r\n\r\nGitVersion can be used in several ways\r\n\r\n - [An MSBuild Task](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion/wiki/MSBuild-Task-Usage)\r\n - [A NuGet Library package](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion/wiki/GitVersion-NuGet-Library) - to use from your own code\r\n - [A Command Line tool](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion/wiki/Command-Line-Tool)\r\n - [A Ruby Gem](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion/wiki/Ruby-Gem)\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nWe have a bunch of examples in our Wiki, if something is missing, let us know! There are examples for GitHubFlow and GitFlow\r\n\r\n### Supported Variables\r\nBecause not everyone is the same, we give you a bunch of different variables which you can use in your builds to meet *your* requirements\r\n\r\n## Additional Links\r\n\r\n### [FAQ and Common Problems](https://github.com/Particular/GitVersion/wiki/FAQ)\r\n\r\n### [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)\r\n\r\n## Icon\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://thenounproject.com/noun/tree/#icon-No13389\" target=\"_blank\">Tree</a> designed by <a href=\"http://thenounproject.com/david.chapman\" target=\"_blank\">David Chapman</a> from The Noun Project\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
